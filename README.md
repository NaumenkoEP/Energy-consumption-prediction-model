# Energy-consumption-prediction-model
this programm generates a fake data set describing the relationship between the temperature in C and the usage of electricity in kW/h, influenced by temperature, weekday and previous usage. Then it trains a small linear regression model which then predicts and evaluates the data. Then in the end it essentially visualises the data by plotting actual VS predicted numbers.

Dependencies:

pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.linear_model - LinearRegression, sklearn.model_selection - train_test_split, sklearn.metrics - mean_squared_error
